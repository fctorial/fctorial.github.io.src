Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the `/collections/config.json` file.

## Adding New Posts

You can add your own posts using either HTML or markdown.

1. For markdown, just create a new markdown file in the `posts` directory.

2. For HTML, copy the `_template.html` file into posts directory and add your content in it.

After that, add an entry for your post into `/collections/posts.json`.

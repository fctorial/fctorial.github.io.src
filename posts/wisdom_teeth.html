        Impacted wisdom tooth is a disorder in which one of the four wisdom teeth of a person starts stabbing the tooth
        next to it. It occurs around the age of 20 in most people, and it hurts <em>a lot</em>. In this article, I'm
        going to share a remedy for wisdom tooth pain that I didn't find anywhere else.

    <p>
        Wisdom tooth pain occurs because there isn't enough room in the human jaw for all 32 of our teeth. You see,
        soft, cooked food is a modern luxury that our ancestors didn't have. Their diet and life was much harder than
        that of ours, and teeth loss was a very common occurrence. Wisdom teeth were an evolutionary mechanism to
        replace any molars that a person would loose by the age of 20, kind of like shark teeth.

        The suggested remedy, and the most commonly used one for wisdom tooth pain is extraction. Sometimes dentist
        even take out unerupted wisdom teeth during an impacted tooth extraction just to save the patient another trip.

        However, there's a non invasive maneuver that I've found to be helpful in case of wisdom tooth pain:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Firmly grab the wisdom tooth that's causing trouble with your thumb and index finger.</li>
        <li>Push it away from the other tooth <em>as hard as you can</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        When you do this, the pain will disappear <em>immediately</em>. It will vanish, and you'll be left with a slight
        itch in the place where the two teeth were touching.
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't need to be gentle with the wisdom tooth because, if it's still erupting, it should be 95% under
        the gums. So you aren't going to rip it out with your bare hands no matter how hard you try. Be careful not to
        cut your fingers though. You could even try wedging your thumb nails between the two teeth and then pushing it
        back. That way you won't hurt your fingers.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <h3 style="color: #ff4d00;">Caution</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure that it is the wisdom tooth that you're grabbing before you start pushing. If you do this
            maneuver on the tooth being stabbed, well, it won't be a very pleasant experience to put it lightly.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        You'll have to do this every couple of hours as long as the wisdom tooth is erupting.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Our jaw isn't made out of concrete. It's made up of bone and cartilage. These materials are strong, but aren't
        very hard. Tooth enamel is by far the hardest material in our body, but the connection between the teeth and the jaw
        is actually quite malleable. That's why braces, and this method, work.

    <p>
        Most article that compares linux distributions start with a statement like this one:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        There is no definite answer to that question.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This statement is false and deceptive. People use this statement when they are trying to avoid offending the
        reader. Human beings get offended whenever someone tries to criticise anything they're related to. That's just
        how humans act. People have a subconscious desire to hear things that validate their own believes, and a
        subconscious repulsion to things that attack their believes. So the author can avoid the reader from going away
        by making a neutral statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coming back to the question in the title, there is a linux distribution that I think is objectively better than
        any other linux distribution that exists.

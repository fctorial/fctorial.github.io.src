    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Nix is a linux package manager that allows users to create programming environments that are completely independent
        of each other. The manifests of these environments look like this:
    </p>
    <prog class="language-nix">
let
  pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs> {};
in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = [
      (pkgs.libpqxx.overrideAttrs
        (oa: {
          patches = [./bugfix.patch];
        }))
    ];
  }

    </prog>
    <p>
        This manifest creates a patched version
        of libpqxx that will only exists inside the environment it will generate. That way users can maintain a separate
        manifest for each project. When they want to work on a project, they can launch a shell in its environment.
        <br/>
        Previously my workflow with the nix package manager looked like this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the project environment in a shell</li>
        <li>Launch intellij/clion from that shell</li>
        <li>Work on the project</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        But if I wanted to work on a project whose environment differs from the one in which the current intellij instance is
        running, I had to kill the current instance and launch another instance in the new environment before I could start
        working on that project.
    </p>

    <h2>Semi-perfect solution</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16864-enter-nix-shell">Enter Nix Shell</a> is an intellij plugin that adds a "run" button to nix files that you open in the ide. When you
        press this button, the plugin will capture the environment of that nix environment and inject it into the intellij
        process, effectively moving the whole IDE into that nix shell:
    </p>
    <video controls>
        <source src="/static/videos/enter_nix/terminal.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <p>
        Obviously any child processes that were already running (daemons, terminals) will not be moved into the
        nix-shell. You'll have to restart them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said this solution is not perfect because some intellij tasks and run configuration will not see the new
        environment under certain circumstances:
    </p>
    <video controls>
        <source src="/static/videos/enter_nix/semi.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <p>
        This is happening because those tasks do not use the process environment directly. They use a layer that caches
        the state of process environment if the environment variable <progi>DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID</progi> is set.
    </p>
    <h2>Perfect solution</h2>
    <p>
        There are two ways you can fix this issue. First is pretty straightforward. Just put <progi>unset DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID</progi>
        somewhere in the <progi>idea.sh</progi> startup script. That will ensure that the edge case is never triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second is to patch your ide code. <a href="/posts/modifying_idea.html">This</a> guide describes
        how to do that without recompiling the ide. You'll have to apply this patch:

        Either way, you'll get a near perfect integration with nix in your ide:

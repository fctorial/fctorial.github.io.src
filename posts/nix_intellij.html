    <p>
        Nix is a linux package manager that allows users to create programming environments that are completely independent
        of each other. The manifest of these environments looks like
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/fctorial/232f616f3d3707717d27510e491ebd26">this</a>. This manifest includes a patched version
        of libpqxx that will only exists inside the environment it will generate. That way users can maintain a separate
        manifest for each project. When they want to work on a project, they can launch a shell in its environment.
        <br/>
        Previously my workflow with the nix package manager looks like this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the project environment in a shell</li>
        <li>Launch intellij/clion from that shell</li>
        <li>Work on the project</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        But if I wanted to work on a project whose environment differs from the one in which the current intellij instance is
        running, I have to kill the current instance and launch another instance in the new environment before I could start
        working on that project.
    </p>

    <h2>Semi perfect solution</h2>
    <a>Enter Nix Shell</a> is an intellij plugin that adds a "run" button to nix files that you open in the ide. When you
    press this button, the plugin will capture the environment of that nix environment and inject it into the intellij
    process.

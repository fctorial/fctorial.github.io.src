        <progi>constexpr.js</progi> executable requires two mandatory arguments, <progi>--input</progi> and
        <progi>--output</progi>. By default (when <progi>--entry</progi> option isn't used), it searches the input
        directory for HTML files, processes them, and writes the result to corresponding paths in the output directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <progi>--entry</progi> option can be used multiple times in an invocation. It's values must be paths of HTML
        files relative to the input root:
    </p>
    <prog>
constexpr.js --input=. --output=../deployment --entry /index.html --entry /subsite/index.html
    </prog>
    <p>
        When constexpr.js is invoked with the <progi>--entry</progi> option, the compiler doesn't search the input
        directory for HTML files. It only compiler the paths specified using this option, and it's left upto those pages
        to define the structure of the rest of the website using <progi>addPaths</progi> <a href="/posts/constexprjs_api_docs.html">api hook</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also use this option to compile only a small number of pages in your website, which might be useful if
        you have a huge website.
    </p>

    <h2>Corollary</h2>
    <p>
        The motivation behind this feature is to decouple the structure of your output website from the filesystem.
        By default, the structure of the website is implicitly determined from the filesystem. This feature allows you
        to offload that decision to constexpr code that you wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design philosophy of constexpr.js goes against that of traditional static site generators which
        have a ton of implicit behavior, and plugins add more implicit behavior on top of that. In order to build a
        website with these SSGs, you need to understand a lot of such implicit behavior, which doesn't have any use
        outside the bounds of the given SSG.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the contrary, constexpr.js is just a tool for executing (and stripping) javascript ahead of time. It just
        happens to be the case that one of the its main use cases is to generate HTML, which is what SSGs do. All of
        your web development knowledge and experience transfers over seamlessly once you start using constexpr.js.
        You can think of constexpr.js as a tool for building SSGs, which is surprisingly easy to do because you'll
        be using a language and runtime whose sole purpose is to deal with HTML and the DOM.

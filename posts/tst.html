        <a href="https://github.com/fctorial/tst">tst</a> is a testing library for clojure(script) that is designed to be
        used from the REPL. In this article, I'm going to describe how to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The base API consists of two entities, the macro <progi>testing</progi> and the function <progi>run-test</progi>.
    </p>
    <h2>Defining a test suite</h2>
    <p>
        <progi>testing</progi> macro is used to define the test suite tree. The leaf nodes in this tree will contain the
        testing logic and the inner nodes will be used to group multiple test suites. An invocation of the
        <progi>testing</progi> macro returns a test suite as a value:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def suite1 (testing :test []
                    {:result :OK
                     :message "A simple test suite"))
    </prog>
    <p>
        The first argument to the macro is the name of the test suite (<progi>:test</progi> in this case). How the rest
        of the arguments are interpreted depends on whether the test suite is a leaf node or an inner node.
    </p>
    <h4>Leaf Nodes</h4>
    <p>
        Leaf nodes must have a vector after the name. The above example is a leaf node. As you can see, it looks a lot
        like a function call. You are supposed to put all the testing logic inside these "functions". It must return a
        clojure map with <progi>:result</progi> as a key. It can throw an error too.
    </p>
    <h4>Inner Nodes</h4>
    <p>
        Inner nodes must contain nested <progi>testing</progi> macro calls following the name:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def suite2 (testing :a
                     (testing :b []
                              {:result :OK})
                     (testing :c []
                              {:result  :ERR
                               :message "failing test"})
                     (testing :d []
                              (throw (new Error))
                              {:result  :OK
                               :message "ignored"}) ))
    </prog>
    <h2>Manipulating test suites</h2>
    <p>
        You can combine multiple test suites into a single suite using <progi>combine-tests</progi> function:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def combined (combine-tests [suite1 suite2]))
    </prog>
    <p>
        A common pattern is to define parts of test suite in different modules and combining them into one big suite in
        the main testing module.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also pull out parts of the test suite as if it were a regular clojure map (it is a regular clojure map):
    </p>
    <prog>
(def suite3 (get combined :test))
(def suite4 (get-in combined [:a :c]))
    </prog>
    <p>
        This can be used to run a subset of the full test suite.
    </p>
    <h2>Running test suites</h2>
    <p>
        <progi>run-test</progi> function can be used to execute a test suite. It returns a result tree whose structure
        matches that of the given test suite.
    </p>
    <prog>
(run-test combined)
{:test {:result :OK,
        :message "A simple test suite"},
 :a {:b {:result :OK},
     :c {:result :ERR,
         :message "failing test"},
     :d {:result :EXCEPTION,
         :exception #error}}}

(run-test (get-in combined [:a :c]))
{:result :ERR, :message "failing test", :state {}}
    </prog>

    <h2>Test state</h2>
    <p>
        Consider the following test unit:
    </p>
    <prog>
(testing :suite []
         (let [a (get-a)
               b (get-b a)]
           (if (= a b)
             {:result :OK}
             {:result :ERR
              :cause  "a and b not equal"
              :a      a
              :b      b})))
    </prog>
    <p>
        What if <progi>get-b</progi> throws an exception. You'll get the following result when you execute this test:
    </p>
    <prog>
{:result    :EXCEPTION
 :exception #error}
    </prog>
    <p>
        The exception info will contain the stack trace, but not the value of local variable <progi>a</progi> that
        caused <progi>get-b</progi> to throw an exception.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can resolve this dilemma by using state variables. The state variables for a test unit are declared in the
        argument vector of the "function" for that test unit:
    </p>
    <prog>
(testing :suite [val-a]
         (let [a (get-a)
               _ (reset! val-a a)
               b (get-b a)]
           (if (= a b)
             {:result :OK}
             {:result :ERR
              :cause  "a and b not equal"
              :a      a
              :b      b})))
    </prog>
    <p>
        The execution context of the test unit will have an atom for each state variable that is declared. You can store
        intermediate state of the test unit inside these atoms, and this state will be available in the test result:
    </p>
    <prog>
{:suite {:result :EXCEPTION,
         :exception #error,
         :state {val-a 1}}}
    </prog>

    <h2>Navigating the test result tree</h2>
    <p>
        You can use the function <progi>get-failed</progi> function to filter tests with
        <progi>(not= status :OK)</progi>:
    </p>
    <prog>
(get-failed (run-test combined))
{:a {:c {:result :ERR, :message "failing test", :state {}},
     :d {:result :EXCEPTION,
         :exception #error}}}
    </prog>
    <p>
        You can use functions <progi>flatten-result</progi> and <progi>treefy-result</progi> if your need more granularity:
    </p>
    <prog>
(->> (run-test combined)
     flatten-result
     (filter my-result-filter)
     treefy-result)
    </prog>
    <p>
        <progi>flatten-result</progi> turns a result tree into a sequence of results and <progi>treefy-result</progi>
        turns a sequence of results back into a tree:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def failed (flatten-result (get-failed (run-test combined))))

; number of failed results
(count failed)

; first failed test:
(first failed)

; stats about test results
(frequencies (map :result (flatten-result (run-test combined))))
{:OK 2, :ERR 1, :EXCEPTION 1}
    </prog>

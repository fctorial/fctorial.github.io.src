        Rust has a reputation of being a difficult language. Part of the reason for that is the strict type system. In
        rust, <progi>mutability</progi> and <progi>lifetime</progi> of an object are a part of its type, so you
        can't call a function with a reference whose lifetime or assigned mutability is incompatible with the signature of
        that function. The compiler infers the lifetimes of most objects automatically at compile time and reports an
        error if it cannot prove that every object will be used only within its lifetime. Because of that rust is a lot
        like a memory managed language in the sense that the programmers don't have to worry about freeing the memory they
        allocated. The compiler will automatically insert <progi>free</progi> calls at the end of the lifetime of an
        object.
    </p>
    <p>
        But unfortunately, it isn't all it's cracked up to be. From time to time you'll encounter situations where
        compiler isn't smart enough to figure out the actual lifetime of an object, or it will stop you from using a
        reference because that violates one of the mutability invariants.

    <p>
        This is the rust equivalent of <progi>reinterpret_cast</progi> of <progi>C++</progi>. You can use it to convert
        a reference of one type to a reference of another type:

    fn f3(r: &'static mut S) {}

    f1(make_mutable(r));
    f2(make_static(r));
    f3(make_mutable(make_static(r)));

    <h2><span>Isn't <progi>unsafe</progi> dangerous?</span></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Yes unsafe is dangerous and water is good for you.
    </p>
    <img src="/static/img/drown.jpg">
    <p>
        It is dangerous only if you don't know what you're doing, and if you're writing a library, there's a good chance that someone
        will use it in a way that you didn't think of, and unsafe code might cause issues there. But if you're writing
        an application that is at the top of dependency tree, there is no reason not to use unsafe when you need to. It
        makes rust a lot less painful.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could say that it isn't possible to draw a clear boundary between application code and library code. Every
        non-trivial application contains a bunch of half baked libraries inside it. But these libraries will have a very
        small number of users and you can actually enforce that it is being used in the correct way everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>"If you're doing that, you might as well be using C/C++"</h2>
    <p>
        Borrow checker isn't the only good thing about rust, and it won't turn into C if you mark all your method as
        <progi>unsafe</progi>. You'll still enjoy the benefits of giant crate ecosystem, tagged unions, cargo, sane
        metaprogramming and really good tooling. <progi>unsafe</progi> doesn't interfere with these features at all.
        I've written a couple of apps like this and haven't seen any segmentation faults or concurrency bugs till now.
